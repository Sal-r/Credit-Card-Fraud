# Project-3-Credit-Card-Fraud
 
Data is extracted from a csv file provided by Kaggle  
Roughly 280,000 transactions  
Cut into snippets of equal cases of fraud & not fraud transactions  
V1-V28 were produced through an obfuscation process called Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For security reasons, we cannot backtrack these numbers to any values that would make sense to us, so our model will only be specific to the non-sensitive data here
