# Credit-Card-Fraud
**Tools Used:**  
* Pandas for data acquisition & data cleaning  
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization  
* SciKit learn for machine learning modeling & scaling  
* Keras for Neural Network  

Data is extracted from a csv file provided by Kaggle and contains roughly 280,000 transactions. To create  into snippets of equal cases of fraud & not fraud transactions  
V1-V28 were produced through an obfuscation process called Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For security reasons, we cannot backtrack these numbers to any values that would make sense to us, so our model will only be specific to the non-sensitive data here

To detect fraud we employed several Machine Learning methods, including SVM, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. A comprehensive analysis of the different Machine Learning methods employed in this project can be found in the Powerpoint Presentation in the Presentations folder.
